SN3218C

Pimoroni makes two easy to use products to control LEDs, based on the 
SN3218 IC:

- PiGlow
- SN3218 18-channel LED Driver

The PiGlow is a ready-to-use PCB with 18 LEDs in 6 different colours 
that you can stick on the GPIO connector of a Pi. Through the I2C port 
you can switch the LEDs on or off by setting their intensities.

The driver board is meant for people who want to build their own system.
You will have to provide the LEDs and make all the connections yourself.
From a driver software point of view the PiGlow and the driver board
are the same thing.

The C driver software has 4 main functions:

- sn3218_open()
- sn3218_close()
- sn3218_set_led()
- sn3218_set_all_leds()

int sn3218_open(void);

This functions opens the I2C port to the SN3218 and locks it, so other
processes (programs) can not interfere.

int sn3218_close(void);

This functions unlocks and closes the I2C port.

uint8_t sn3218_set_led(uint8_t ledno, uint8_t intensity);

The set_led function sets the intensity level of a single LED.
That LEDs are numbered from 1 to 18 and there are 256 intensity levels 
to choose from (0 is off, 255 is maximum intensity).

uint8_t sn3218_set__all_leds(uint8_t intensity);

The set_all_leds function sets the intensity level of all 18 LEDs at the
same time.

Gamma intensities

The array sn3218_gamma[SN3218_GAMMA] is a selection of 32 predefined
intensity levels that you can use instead the 256 available levels.
